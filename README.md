# Telecom Churn Analysis

## Problem Statement

Customer churn refers to when a customer ceases their relationship with a company, such as a player, subscriber, or user. The cost of customer churn includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved in acquiring new customers to replace those lost. Therefore, reducing customer churn is crucial for businesses, as the cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than retaining an existing one. The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry and predict whether a customer will churn based on certain parameters.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to the telecom industry, including various parameters that can potentially influence customer churn. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify the factors that contribute to churn and build predictive models to forecast whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
